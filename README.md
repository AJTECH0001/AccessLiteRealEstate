# AssetLite: A ZetaChain Smart Contract for Property Tokenization

## Overview
AssetLite is a Solidity smart contract deployed on the ZetaChain network. It enables the creation and management of digital properties as tokenized assets. Properties can be minted with specific characteristics (total supply, price per token, URI), and ownership can be transferred in fractional shares.

### Key Features

Property Creation: The contract owner can create new properties with defined parameters.
Ownership Management: Property owners can transfer ownership shares to other addresses.
Fractional Ownership: Ownership of a property can be divided into fractional shares.
ZetaChain Integration: Leverages ZetaChain's cross-chain capabilities for interoperability.
How it Works
Deployment: The contract is deployed on the ZetaChain network, requiring the address of the SystemContract as a constructor argument.
Property Creation: The contract owner can create new properties by specifying the total supply, price per token, and a URI.
Ownership Transfer: Property owners can transfer ownership shares to other addresses. The total remaining supply of the property is updated accordingly.
Ownership Verification: The contract provides a function to query ownership shares for a specific property and address.
Property Metadata: The contract stores a URI for each property, which can be used to retrieve additional information about the property.
ZetaChain Integration
The contract utilizes the SystemContract and zContract interfaces from the @zetachain/protocol-contracts library. This allows the contract to interact with ZetaChain's core functionalities, including cross-chain messaging and asset transfers.

Potential Use Cases
Real Estate Tokenization: Represent physical properties as digital assets on the blockchain.
Art and Collectibles: Fractional ownership of valuable art pieces or collectibles.
Gaming Items: In-game items as tradable assets.
Crowdfunding: Raise funds for projects by selling ownership shares.
Prerequisites
A ZetaChain account and network setup
Solidity development environment
Basic understanding of smart contracts and blockchain technology
Getting Started
Clone this repository.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Deploy the contract to the ZetaChain network using a suitable deployment tool.
Interact with the contract using a web3 wallet or a development environment.
Important Considerations
Security: Thoroughly audit the contract for vulnerabilities before deploying.
Gas Optimization: Optimize the contract for gas efficiency to reduce transaction costs.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
Legal Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and laws.
Note: This is a basic implementation and may require additional features and refinements for production use.
